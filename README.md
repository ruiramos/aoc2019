# aoc2019

Participating in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) for the first time this year! Will try to stick to it for as long as possible, solving the problems in Rust and/or JS.


For Rust, I'm simply creating `.rs` scripts and running them with [cargo-script](https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script), ie

```
cargo script index.rs
```
